So that when the customer enters the store, we can know what the customer's name is, before or when drinking from there every time. Customers ordering food can say: "Yes! E hello Mr(sister) Nguyen Van A yesterday, you ordered this drink today, do you want to try to change it to another flavor, now my shop has a new and delicious taste. After drinking it, I will give you a little review.".

## üëâ Build
* **Description attribute**
    * What kind of face does the customer have: oval, round, square...
    * Long or short hair color of hair.
    * How tall is the guest?
    * The customer is male or female.
    * What is the name of the guest: Mr. A, Ms. B, Ms. C...
    * Favorite drinks: honey lemon tea, kumquat aloe vera tea, peach orange lemongrass tea, snack set, sunflower ..
    * Go with friends or alone.
    * Hours often come.
    * Guests often go on holidays or not.
    * Which season is more crowded.
    * How often does the guest return?


* **Label attributes to predict:**
    Identify the customer's face, then state what the customer's name is, drink before calling.


* **Data collection method:**
    The data can be collected and calculated manually, taking photos of guests and attaching a note: "guess name, drink, ordered dish" then using AI we will use an algorithm to teach the machine that this is a guest What does A order, customer B, C... order something. From there, the machine will learn the math and will handle it automatically every time customers A, B, C... come to the shop.


* **Deployment techniques and model building:**
    * Initially, it is a supervised learning method. Because supervised learning is that we have used previously labeled data to infer the relationship between the output and the input. At first we label it. Here is what customer A ordered, what customer B ordered.
    * After learning that we don't monitor it anymore, it will adjust itself every time a guest comes in. It will have to identify itself as customer A and what has been ordered before, this is what guest B ordered =) unsupervised learning.
    * Deep learning, the machine learning has to learn slowly, adjust a little, perform the math many times to save, each time tweak a little to improve the results. To train the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwe gather historical data of customers upon arrival. Take the input from the dataset then compare its output with the sample dataset output. Once we're done with the data set, we can create a function that displays the deviation of the AI's output from the actual output. This function is called the training Cost Function.
    * Image recognition: At first, we teach it to learn, then the machine will have to self-align so that the customer's name must match the customer's face
